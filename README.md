# bank_simulation
simulation of a bank with ATMs and tellers

I used the simpy library (https://simpy.readthedocs.io/), 
version 3 (Python 3).

I was inspired by the simpy tutorials to learn the library
and to build the simulator, although I rewrote all the code and
adapted it to the tellers and atms problem.
